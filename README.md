# Johan 'Speekz' Bejar

## About Me
I have worked on the Front-End side for VC-funded startups like Lifebrand. I also created a ticketing system for the Peru Comic Con 23 and a platform for CSGO players to find matches across Latin America. I loved talking to stakeholders and am happy to contribute to building modern web apps.
